      desc1 : "Using Verilog HDL to design a FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), I built a simple Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) by designing computer datapaths controlled by a Moore  type finite state machine. The RISC machine is capable of receiving, decoding, and running multiple 16-bit instruction sets from fetching user input or by navigating encoded instructions using a load-enabled program counter. Simple instructions include loading/storing from Read-Write memory-declared registers, utilizing logic-block registers and, using an arithmetic logic unit, computing arithmetic problems as complex as floating-point matrix multiplications.",
      desc2 : "In order to ensure that the RISC machine was “Turing-complete”, the RISC machine was made to support branches as additional instruction sets in order to support loops and function calls. As a bonus, a working interrupt service routine (ISR) was included to support interrupting the main program flow through user input.",
      desc3 : "Due to the nature of the project, a rigorous and efficient development sequence was used, which included detailed design before its manufacturing and techniques in revision testing (git) and rigorous regression testing conducted after each iteration/change. Verilog testbenches and waveform analysis were used to constantly test the functionality of the machine.",

      proj : "February 2019, Academic Team Project",
      desc1 : "The Oven Reflow Controller is a prototype program that is used to control a basic lab oven to conduct reflow soldering, a process of permanently soldering small surface mount components on a printed circuit board (PCB). Having a specific thermal profile, the oven needed to be precise in terms of its operating temperature and time throughout the process, to prevent overheating and burning the solder paste and PCB.",
      desc2 : "The main components of the oven controller includes a general-purpose thermocouple and serial connections from the microcontroller to the thermocouple and SSR (solid state relay) controlling the oven’s power. Programming was done almost entirely in assembly, and testing done through simple python plots and GUIs. The reflow oven parameters (temperature, time) were fully adjustable through pushbuttons connected to GPIO pins on the microcontroller, and real-time temperature readings could be observed directly from either the LCD screen or through python plots.",
      desc3 : "A Mealy state machine was used to control the different stages of the reflow process, with real-time input from the K-type thermocouple constantly injected and checked by the program. In the case of errors, the program automatically shuts down the oven through its connection to the solid state relay. Otherwise, the program seeks user attention using audio modules installed in its circuitry. Additionally, simple password protection through the PuTTy platform was implemented to prevent accidental or misuse of the program.",

Output from the sensor were boarded onto a circuit with equipped with amplifiers and simple filters, and the option of a Schmitt Trigger Comparator to ensure that a clean signal is passed onto the microcontroller. The period of the signal was calculated and converted into BPM (beats per minute), which was sent through a serial port and displayed on a simple graphical user interface (GUI) coded in python.",
      desc3 : "Software-side, a simple GUI was designed to visualize the user’s heart-rate, provide user interfacing, and return therapeutic feedback. Based on the user’s settings and measured heart-rate, the interface will start playing therapeutic music in attempt to alleviate physical, emotional, or mental distress. The user can enter his/her age, gender, and body weight, and save them to named profiles, which will be used to alter way the criteria and the way the device responses.",
